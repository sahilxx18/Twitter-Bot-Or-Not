# Twitter-Bot-Or-Not
Aimed at analyzing the effectiveness and performance of different machine learning algorithms in its ability to classify twitter accounts as bots or humans. For obvious reasons, this is treated as classification problem. We evaluated the generalization performance and the predictive performance of all the models on future data. Based on the results we find the best suited machine learning algorithm for the given hypothesis space.
